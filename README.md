## Overview

CKata is a collection of algorithm implementations written in C++. The goal of this project is to practice and improve coding skills by implementing various algorithms across different domains, such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, cryptography, AI, and more. Each algorithm is organized into its respective domain and includes documentation and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need the following software installed:

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (minimum version 3.10)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CKata.git
   cd CKata
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

### Running the Algorithms

Each algorithm is implemented in its own folder. To run a specific algorithm, navigate to its directory and follow the build and run instructions provided in its `README.md` file.

### Testing

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` folder within each domain and follow the build and run instructions provided in the `README.md` file for the tests.
